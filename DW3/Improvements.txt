Name entry (including beginning) can be optimized, see name entry of 2nd fighter
Sell all unequipped items at begginning to save time scrolling to the wings & key
Perhaps sell equipped armor too?
Buy 1 extra wings at beginning for use after registering party
Buy a 2nd if enough money to do so in order to use a wing after getting the magic ball to exit town faster
At beginning, manipulate girl to not get in the way on town exit
Better luck manipulation on enemy avoidance
Register fighters then merchant to avoid scrolling past his name twice when adding party members
19 str 9 agility possible with both fighters, is 10 agility possible?
