Optimization goals:
# Minimal frame count
# Timer slowed down as much as possible to achieve most impressive timer readings
There is a 1/8 chance that goal 2 may hinder goal 1 in the score tallying phase,
but I took this risk willingly. The movie thus sacrifices time for.. time.

Room 3:
	
	There exists a faster way to pass the sparkling
	at the bottom edge. However, doing so will cause the
	gargoyle at left edge to shoot at an unfavorable moment,
	causing an extra wait.
	You could, avoid that shooting without delay by shooting
	the gargoyle instead, but then you would miss the chances
	of affecting the behavior of the cows, resulting in delays
	at the center room when jumping over the cows.

Room 4:
	
	Previous movie got 9330 in timer, this got 9320.
	I could have got 9330 by being one frame _slower_.
	Yes, the timer is _weird_.

Room 10:
	In the previous movie I had great trouble getting 8300 in the
	timer -- I once succeeded and then never again. Thanks to the
	robot-assisted playing, I got 8320 this time.

Room 11:
	Getting this room to actually _work_ -- being able to reach the
	little tunnel before the enemy in the ceiling shoots Dana --
	turned out to be nearly impossible. In fact, the bot tried this
	for two days straight without success. Until, I extended the scope
	into the previous stage as well; the way the previous stage ended
	affected whether this stage succeeded or not.
