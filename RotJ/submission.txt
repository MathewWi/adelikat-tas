Level 1 Boss
I had to lose 17 frames here 
the boss jumps higher in the air so I have to wait more to hit him
then when I hit him I can get the hoppless bounce off the punch that is needed to do a good combo on him
I've tried more lag & less lag, delaying frames, changing small things in the level, and having different # of batarangs, and nothing makes him do the lower jump
