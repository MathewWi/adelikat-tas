Some screen transitions are variable because of lag
In some cases scrolling text using the first frame is 2 frames slower than waiting for the arrow (lag), this is for text during/after screen transitions and level ups, I think
When doing a visibility transition (where the black part of a screen changes, like in caves) the transition is variable.  Entering on different squares can have a different effect.  My guess is random buttons will too.
When ending text and moving, use the button you will use to move, it can save 2 frames.  For instance, end a convo with someone and have to move down.  Press down on the last text scroll, and hold it.
Going into battles has variable lag.  As well as each person's turn.
Towns can be laggy!  Different paths into the town can avoid lag frames due to scrolling while people are moving.
