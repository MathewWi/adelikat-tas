copy of DW4.fm2 is movie that is 2 frames faster. 

Delaying the button press at 7821 (after "A voice is heard out of nowhere..."), 
by 1 frame, draws the text box of the priest 2 frames faster than DW4.fm2.

However, instead, delaying the button press at 7918, by 1 frame, costs 3 additional frames, 
before the drawing of the text box. I left DW4.fm2 in here, because this has to be seen to be believed.

Frame perfect text boxes cause lag 2 more inputs away...

I am back to hating this game.
