If there is any character worthy of a _speed_ run it is Speedy Gonzalez!

Also, no JXQ isn't back.  He started this TAS some years ago and got to the end of 2-1.  I decided to finish where he left off.

As always, I recommend downloading my [http://code.google.com/p/adelikat-tas/downloads/list|release package] as it includes the movie file as well as other accessories such as level savestates, memory watch files, spreadsheets, etc.

! Noteworthy Game Physics

*Super Speed
**Obviously the TAS maker of this game is the Arrows, as they vault Speedy into Speedy Gonzalez worthy speeds.
**When at super speeds, if speedy presses the opposite direction for even one frame, his speed is immediately reset to normal speed.
*Downhill walking
**When at normal speed being on a downhill floor for any length of time will boost Speedy's speed from 384 to 416 until he presses the opposite direction or walks on an uphill floor.
**When at super speed, his speed will continue to increase for every frame he is on it!  There seems to be no speed cap in this situation.
*Uphill walking
**When at normal speed, this has no affect
**When at 416 speed, this will immediately reset it to 384 (normal speed)
**When at super speeds, this will drain Speedy's speed each frame he is on it.  This can come in handy too though, in order to make it under ledges or other obstacles since pressing left immediately stops super speed.
*Jumping
**Sucks.  You can not control the height of your jumps.  This leads to some awkward looking sections.  
*Health
**The programmers were nice enough to give you 3 whole hits before you die!  And they reset it once each _world_.  How generous!
**So for the entire world taking damage must be planned, as you only get 2 hits to work with.
**You can get health refills along the way.  In some cases this is worth it, as taking more hits saves more time than it costs to get the refills.
*Weaponsbut 
**Weapons will last until the boss fight of a world.  
**Getting weapons is often worth the cost since you can hurt enemies and thus avoid damage.
**In some levels you must get a weapon in order to bust obstacles.
**The sledgehammer is cool as balls.
