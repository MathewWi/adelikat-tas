Comparing to the previous movie will be VERY difficult here.  For one thing, this movie will probably be longer than the previous.

The famtasia emulator emulated the load times much too short.  Therefore the new movie with FCEUX's accurate load times will be significantly longer.

With famtasia, I can not get accurate frame counts, but even if I could, they would have to be based on the level I am in only, since load times will obscure the actual frame counts.

For convenience, I am basing improvements off the avi in virtual dub, which should be somewhat accurate in terms of frame counts.  I will compare some point in the beginning of the level to some point at the end.

One more obstacle, what are these levels called?  There is no room number or any other indicator that I can tell, so I will use my best description.

Given these circumstances, my calculations maybe somewhat off.

About step calculations.  For my steps I am using a step counter lua script provided in the SVN.  For bag's I am...just trying to count them, so expect that number to be potentially off slightly.

Improvements

The level after the 1st room entrance glitch, about frame 8468 in my movie
Comparing from when lolo turns after walking out of the medusa to when the screen scrolls.
mine: 9829 - 8514 = 1315
bag:  9494 - 8098 = 1396
81 frames

I walked 87 steps, bag walked 83.

Better strategy for handling the red rolling enemy thing at the bottom of the screen.

Room at about 29000 (my movie), going a better route to the key, about 96 frames
