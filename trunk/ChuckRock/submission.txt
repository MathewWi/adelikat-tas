As always, I have provided a [http://code.google.com/p/adelikat-tas/downloads/list|release package] on my my googlecode project.
It includes the movie file, submission text, and level savestates.

This is a 9.83 second (590 frame) improvement over the [http://tasvideos.org/827M.html|previous] movie by AKA.  This project started some years ago by Cardboard.  I got involved and we TASed most of level 1 before Aqfaq posted a WIP that had some small improvements requiring us to redo from the start.  This stalled the project for awhile, but recently I picked it back up and finished it up.

!! Improvements

!Level 1 (179 frames)

The lag counter goes crazy in this game, however most "lag" frames are not destructive because the screen still scrolls.  Heavier lag is "destructive" lag in that it freezes the screen for that frame.  To distinguish between the two, I wrote a lua script to count frames where the screen fails to scroll.  There were a lot of misc lag frames saved in this level but the big improvement is a nice shortcut just before the boss.  It involves throwing a rock then jumping on it while it is in midair, in order to reach high ledges.  Thanks to aqfaq for discovering this shortcut!  The boss was improved about 50 frames with a slightly different strategy.

!Level 2 (5 frames)

Not much here, mostly just walking to the right, and little to no lag.

!Level 3 (3 frames)

Ditto

!Level 4 (185 frames)

The big improvement here is the shortcut near the beginning of the level.  I use a rock to get up to a ledge rather than hopping to the left on ledges.  There is also a nice damage boost shortcut done later in the screen.  There are also lots of other small improvements as well.

!Level 5 (218 frames)

217 of the 218 frames here was saved on the boss.  Rather than jumping on the ledges and attacking the bosses head, I stay on the ground and belly flop him.  The key to a fast fight is to manipulate him into doing the charging move as often and as fast as possible.  The end result is awkard and sloppy looking but that is really how the boss fight needs to go down.
