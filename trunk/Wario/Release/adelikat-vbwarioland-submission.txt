This is an Best ending version of Virtual Boy Wario Land.  It aims to get all hidden treasures in the game.  Getting all treasures allows for showing off not only the game but more strategies as well.  It also shows off all the diferent Wario power-ups.  Eagle Wario is the optimal for getting from point A to B quick but often Fire or Dragon Wario is needed to access secret areas that contain treasures.  Thus I must switch items.  Unfortunately to switch requires taking damage usually in order to be able to pick up new power-ups.
